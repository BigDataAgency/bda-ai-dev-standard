# Test Scenario Report Template

> ใช้สำหรับ QA/product evidence: test case / scenario execution พร้อม screenshot capture และ report generation เท่านั้น ไม่ใช่ Daily Log, performance review, score, KPI หรือการประเมินบุคคล

Status summary vocabulary: Pass / Fail / Blocked / Not run (map to detailed statuses such as PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED_*, NOT_RUN as needed).

## Summary

- Report title:
- Product/feature:
- Environment: local / dev / staging / production-read-only / other
- Base URL:
- Build/version/commit:
- Date/time:
- Tester/agent/tool:
- Role/account type used:
- Test account classification: no credentials / real user / synthetic test / impersonation / limited-role / production read-only / other
- Credentials/secrets included in report? no only
- Browser/device/viewport:
- Data/privacy constraints:

## Non-performance confirmation

- [ ] This report is QA/product evidence
- [ ] This report is not Daily Log
- [ ] This report is not a performance review, score, KPI, daily performance, or individual evaluation
- [ ] Role/team/account context is only for scenario reproducibility

## Production read-only guardrail checklist

- Environment contains production/real data? yes / no / unknown
- Allowed actions: view-only / navigation-only / no submit / no mutation / other:
- Forbidden production actions checked: create / edit / delete / approve / reject / upload / import / export / download sensitive docs
- Explicit scope allows production write action? no / yes, specify approval and action:
- Auth/session bypass attempted? no only
- No-mutation/network-write criteria:
- Stop condition for PII/write-risk:

## Test account classification

- Account/session used: no credentials / real user / synthetic test / impersonation / limited-role / production read-only / privileged admin
- Authorized by / scope reference, no secret:
- Roles/permissions expected:
- Roles/permissions observed:
- Credentials/tokens/passwords included? no only
- Limitations from account/session:

## Navigation and scope notes

- User-facing navigation rule: visible-menu navigation used? yes / no / not applicable
- Direct URL/hidden route used? no / yes, technical verification only:
- Standard wording if direct URL used: Technical verification only — this direct URL/hidden route check verifies observed routing/auth behavior under the stated session and permissions. It must not be claimed as a completed user-facing journey unless reachable via visible navigation.
- Production write risk: none / controlled test data / blocked / other:
- Route source types used: visible menu / direct URL / source code route / old docs / browser redirect / deployed bundle
- Out of scope:
